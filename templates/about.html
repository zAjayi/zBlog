              <p>Antoinette Ekeruche is the oldest of three kids. Growing up, she always had been an avid reader and could always be found huddled up in a corner of her house with a book in her hands. Reading was always an escape for her, and she always admired how writers were able to paint beautiful pictures with just their words.</p>
              <p>After a while she started writing stories, creating worlds where anything and everything was possible. Though she never told anyone about the passion she had developed for writing she would however tell her friends and family about her stories.</p>
              <p>2020 was a whirlwind of emotions and experiences for the writer and after the pandemic forced everyone indoors, writing became the only way she could express the innumerable complex emotions she felt. It became her escape, her therapist, and her saving grace. After the pandemic, she had learnt a lot about herself and realized that many were lost, grasping for support and unable to see anything.</p>
              <p>In 2022, she finally gained the courage and started a blog, writing articles she believed would shed light into the darkness and would help people out of it, to let them understand that they were never alone, that their lives could be better and that they could somehow find peace in life.</p>
